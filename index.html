    <h4 class="main">I received a 
      job offer mid-course, 
      and the subjects 
     I learned were current,
     if not more so, 
      in the company I joined.
      I honestly feel 
      I got every 
     penny’s worth.</h4>
   
    <p> “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
     transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
     for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
     The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
     the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR 
     startup. ”</p>

     <h4 class="main"> Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
     learning from their experiences was easy.</h4>

     <p> “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
     gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
     junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
      an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>

   <h4 class="Jeanette-main">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h4>

  <p class="jeanette-p"> “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
   professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
   student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
   did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
   project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
    could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
   experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
    100% recommend! ”<p>
